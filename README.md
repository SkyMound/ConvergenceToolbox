# Setup

Start by executing Convergence and LiveSplit.  
(**If you just installed LiveSplit Server**, LS Server wont appear under Control, so lets add it : go to Edit Layout&rarr;click on the '+' icon&rarr;Control&rarr;LS Server)

Now you can right click on LS&rarr;Control&rarr;Start Server.

Finally, you can execute CTB. If all works well, you should see your CTB version in the down right corner.
